A collection of code examples, based on the [Hadoop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadoop) open source project at Apache.

This project is intended to explore applications of [MapReduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) programming techniques for handling large data sets within a [distributed computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) framework... and provide more examples for other developers to learn to use Hadoop (currently using version 0.15.3) which you will need to download: http://hadoop.apache.org/

Components:
  * "jyte" - approximation of jyte.com "cred scores" using a PageRank algorithm
  * "canopy" - Java implementation of canopy clustering, from McCallum, Nigam, Ungar
